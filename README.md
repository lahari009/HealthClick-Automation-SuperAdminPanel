# HealthClick Automation – Super Admin Panel

## Project Overview
This project covers end-to-end automation testing of the HealthClick Super Admin panel. The automation validates the complete positive user flow to ensure that all core functionalities work accurately and smoothly across the application.

The automation framework is structured using standard industry practices, with a strong focus on maintainability, reusability, and scalability.

## Automated Test Coverage
The automation suite validates the following functionalities:
- Login and Forgot Password
- Dashboard validations
- Menu and sub-menu navigation
- Form validations
- Filter and search operations
- CRUD operations where applicable
- Complete end-to-end user flow
- Logout functionality

## Bug Logging
A custom automated Bug Logger is integrated into the automation framework. Whenever a test failure occurs, the framework captures the failure details and logs them into an Excel-based bug report. The report includes module name, test scenario, expected and actual results, error details, and execution timestamp. This implementation reduces manual effort and improves defect traceability.

## Test Reporting
HTML-based automated test reports are generated after execution. The reports provide clear visibility of test execution results, including pass/fail status and overall execution summary.
